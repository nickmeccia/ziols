<p class="head_2">dental insurance</p>

<p>We would be pleased to assist you in maximizing your insurance benefits by completing your claim forms. Please remember that our professional services are rendered and charged to you, not your insurance company. Dental insurance pays only a portion of your investment. Your actual coverage depends on a variety of factors.</p>

<p>Most plans base the amount of benefits on a schedule of fees arbitrarily developed by insurance companies, not from the actual fees charged by an office. As a result, you may receive a lower percentage than the reimbursement level indicated in your dental plan.</p>
